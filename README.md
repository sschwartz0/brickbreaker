# Free to use react/redux "starter" app/environment

## "npm install and start" and you're up and running! "npm run server" to start the express server.

The point of this repo was for me to create an evolving starter kit for my React projects that includes only the necessities and the tooling to make coding easier. This allows me to start coding a new project in minutes.

Includes:
- Tooling
-- Webpack dev (with HMR) and prod
-- Babel with ES6
-- Typescript
-- Eslint, tslint

- Frontend
-- React/Redux
-- Template module with actions and reducer in typescript
-- SCSS file

- Backend
-- Simple express server with nodemon
